## Password Choice
[![Computerphile Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3NjQ9b3pgIg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg)

To choose a good password, you need to:
* Make the password as *long* as possible while being able to be easily remembered
    * Good Examples:
        * "Broken_Toaster_Confederation69"
        * "Riven_is_not_Overpowered76"
        * "Kitchen_Master_Sucks99"
    * Bad Examples: 
        * "m1k32m4m1mlk14k21m4lk214m3k" <--- *Long, but easily forgettable*
        * "Timothy" <--- *Easily remembered, but short*

### Theory behind this: 
The time it requires to guess a password scales *exponentially* with the length of the password. This means that a longer password will *significantly* increase the time that a hacker needs to guess your password. It takes approximately *19 hours* to crack a 9-character password "BurBurnet," but it takes *3 thousand years* to guess a 12-character password "BurBurnet888"
