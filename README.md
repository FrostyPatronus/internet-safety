## Password Choice
[![Computerphile Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3NjQ9b3pgIg/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg)

To choose a good password, you need to:
* Make the password as *long* as possible while being able to be easily remembered
    * Good Examples:
        * "Broken_Toaster_Confederation69"
        * "Riven_is_not_Overpowered76"
        * "Kitchen_Master_Sucks99"
    * Bad Examples: 
        * "m1k32m4m1mlk14k21m4lk214m3k" <--- Long, but easily forgettable
        * "Timothy" <--- Easily remembered, but short
